# Project coding guidelines
- Be concise.
- Prioritize developer experience and readability.
- Prefer simple, direct solutions over scalability; the guest list stays under ~100 entries.
- Avoid over-engineering and unnecessary abstractions.
- Favor clear naming and minimal configuration.
- all queries and mutations should have check the user session and validate inputs simply.
- Break layouts into small, reusable components where it improves clarity.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling; avoid custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.
